This is my first application using APIs and JSON files.

This is a simple Twitter bot that translates tweets directed at it into Klingon and replies the result back to the sender. It has a finite lifespan of 2M calls- Azure services begins to charge for anything after that.

Many thanks to Daniel Shiffman at The Coding Train, @ttezel for Twit, and @nanek for mstranslator.
